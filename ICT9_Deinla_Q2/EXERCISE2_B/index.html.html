	<h1>My Three Favorite Books</h1>
	<center><div class="container">
		<div class="item" id="box1">
			<h2>"Little Women"</h2>
			<p>Authored by Louisa May Alcott, Little Women revolves around the story of the March family, comprised of sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. The book covers their life as teenage girls living in the middle of the American Civil War, in which their father was deployed on the side of the Union armies. Other characters include their charismatic albeit unruly next door neighbor, Laurie Laurence, his wealthy grandfather Mr. Laurence, and the gruff Professor Bhaer. It is one of my favorite books of all time because of the pristine prose and writing, the spectacular story, and the exciting edge with which it developed the relationships between the various characters.</p>

			<h2>"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"</h2>
			<p>Authored by Suzanne Collins, the book is the prequel to the acclaimed "Hunger Games" trilogy by the same author. It covers the earlier life and the rise of Coriolanous Snow, the villain of the original trilogy and President of Panem, the fictional future nation the story takes place in. It documents Snow's rise from a family damaged by rebellion from the districts to a Gamemaker for the Hunger Games, a cannibalistic and violent reality show developed as punishment against the districts for their act of rebellion against the Capitol. Other main characters include Lucy Gray Baird, the District 12 tribute who Snow has to mentor, and Dean Casca Highbottom, Dean of the Capitol's Academy and the creator of the Hunger Games. I love the story because of its gripping and on-the-edge-of-your-seat narrative, the side plots, as well as the final 100 pages, which for the first time in my life kept me up until 1am.</p>

			<h2>"Paris, 1919"</h2>
			<p>Authored by Margaret Macmillan, this book helped propel my interest in history. At over 600 pages long the book was a beast that took me months to read, but it was worth it. Also called "Peacemakers", the book is an in-depth and extremely detailed account of the 1919 Paris Peace Conference that took place at the end of the First World War, which lasted from 1914 to 1918. The 1919 Peace Conference shaped the post-imperial world and laid down the groundwork for the Second World War, and essentially dictated the path of human history. The book goes deep into testimonies and the personal diaries of presidents and prime ministers who attended the Conference, the conflicts between heads of state, and the petitions from peoples across the world for their own independent nations. The book, while long and arduous to read at times, was still extremely rewarding and delivered me immense swathes of information on one of the most influential albeit underrated events in human history.</p>
