			<h2>Communism</h2>
			<p>Communism is a political philosophy devised by Karl Marx that adovcates for a classless society and the abolition of private ownership. It essentially states that all physical objects and other items that can be owned by any one person shall be owned publicly, by the government, to facilitate for a fair redistribution of wealth. Persons are then going to work and be paid according to their specific needs and abilities; no more and no less. While the system on paper promises a fair society where there is true economic and social equality, the implementation of communism in countries like the former Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China has proven that communism possesses major flaws that could significantly damage a society's growth, especially when it comes to the lack of competition generated by communist economic systems.</p>

			<h2>Democracy</h2>
			<p>Democracy is a political system that emerged in Ancient Greece after it was invented and implemented by the city-state of Athens. It calls for individual liberty and freedoms and establishes a system through which voters will be able to select their representatives in government (representative democracy) or a system through which voters directly vote on legislative policy proposals (direct democracy). The system rose to prominence after the American Revolution in 1776, when the first fully democratic nation was established. Democracy became widespread after the revolutions of 1848, the collapse of royalism in Europe and the rise of republicanism, and subsequently the domination of the world by Western democratic powers post-WW1. While democracy - capitalistic democracies particularly - have thrived the best in the long-term, democratic system of government has prevented long-term progress from being implemented thanks to constant change in government, and democratic backsliding is taking place, where anti-democratic forces are beginning to win elections.</p>
